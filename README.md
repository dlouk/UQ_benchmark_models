# UQ_benchmark_models
This is a collection of benchmark models that I have used for uncertainty 
quantification (UQ) purposes. Pretty much, they are parametric models, the 
parameters of which can be easily recasted as random variables (RVs). They have 
been predominantly used to test own UQ software, as well as to perform UQ 
studies and develop surrogate models with UQLab, SPINTERP, Chaospy, OpenTURNS, 
and the MATLAB-Sparse-Grids-Kit.
