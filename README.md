# UQ_benchmark_models
This is a collection of benchmark models that I have used for uncertainty 
quantification (UQ) purposes. They are parametric models, the parameters of 
which can be easily recasted as random variables (RVs). They have been 
predominantly used to test own UQ software, as well as to perform UQ studies 
and develop surrogate models with UQLab, SPINTERP, Chaospy, OpenTURNS, and the 
MATLAB-Sparse-Grids-Kit. UQ studies using the models provided in this repository 
are available in the following works:
